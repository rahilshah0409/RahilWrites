            It is fair to say that sport is a part of many people’s lives. Whether one plays a sport, either
            recreationally or professionally, or follows current sporting events and news, it acts as something that
            connects people across the world. And then you have the athletes and sports teams that define the sport and
            make it what it is. Michael Jordan. Usain Bolt. Cristiano Ronaldo. Teams like the Australian National
            Cricket team. The New Zealand Rugby team. Several football teams like Real Madrid, Manchester United, PSG
            and Bayern Munich. The chances are that some of these names are familiar to you even if you are not a sports
            fan- testament to their incredible skill and success.
        </p>

        <p>
            When a lot of people see these athletes, I think they place them on a grand pedestal in their minds, way
            above what is considered as a “normal human being”, and hence create a mental gap between the image of them
            and one’s self. To understand what I mean by this, ask yourself whether or not you would compare yourselves
            to the likes of Kobe Bryant or Lionel Messi in any way. I know I would not- I tend to go about my day trying
            to find the motivation to do the coursework I have been assigned or pursue my simple hobbies, not prepare
            for a game that could win a match being watched by millions of people worldwide. The point is that we
            picture two completely different ways of living. However recently, I decided to look into the habits and
            strategies of world class athletes and sports teams, trying to answer one question. How are they so
            successful? To my surprise, there is a lot more that we can apply to our daily lives than one may think and
            making the connection between their approach to their sport and our own lives is the aim of this article.

        <h4 class="center-align"><b>Mindset towards success and failure</b></h4>

        <p>
            It is no secret that we go through times of great joy and times of great difficulty. This is something that
            all of us face, whether it be your friends and family or famous sports personalities. For the football fans
            out there, you may remember the 2008 Champions League final between Chelsea and Manchester United; a tense
            final that went down to penalties, where John Terry slipped and missed his penalty (essentially handing the
            trophy to Man U- something that broke my heart as a 7 year old Chelsea fan). However, sports teams and
            players experience great success as well, having periods where they seem unbeatable. For example, if you
            have watched “The Last Dance”, you will certainly be familiar of the success of the Chicago Bulls in the
            1990s, winning 6 championships in 8 years. So the question is: how do players deal with failures and what is
            their mindset towards success?
        </p>

        <p>
            From the stories that I have read or heard about, two main themes seem to stick out to me. The first is what
            Dawn Staley (American basketball Hall of Fame player and coach) calls the 24 hour rule. In the documentary
            “The Playbook: A Coach’s Rules for Life”, she expresses the principle of moving past a major success or
            cruel failure after 24 hours, something that she lived by and instilled into her players. This puts the
            spotlight on something that is applicable to all of us- it is important that we have the ability to push
            past such experiences (good or bad) and continue to work hard to pursue greater things in the future.
            However, something that Staley encapsulates well in this documentary is that this needs to be balanced with
            taking the time to be overwhelmed with the emotion that comes from success or failure. It is beneficial for
            us to accept these emotions, whether that be basking in the glory of a huge win or agonising over a massive
            defeat, and is the best way to move on from that event.
        </p>

        <p>
            The second is expressed by many successful people both within and outside of the world of sport- the search
            for constant improvement. In the book “Legacy: What The All Blacks Can Teach Us About The Business Of Life”,
            the New Zealand Rugby team follow a profound quote: “When you’re at the top of your game, change your game”.
            The basic idea is that the most successful teams and athletes are those who are constantly looking to
            improve their skills and awareness of the game, even when it seems that no one can beat them. This mentality
            can bring significant benefits to us if it is applied in the right situation. Having the desire to improve
            at all times is something that we could all adopt in some area of our lives, whether that be through asking
            more questions related to your course to seek better understanding or putting in more time to carry out a
            responsibility to the best of your ability. There is always room for improvement.

        <h4 class="center-align"><b>Consistency and persistence = delayed gratification</b></h4>

        <p>
            I’ll put my hands up and admit that I like motivational videos and success stories. When watching these
            videos, the idea of regular habits continues to pop up a lot. “Becoming successful at something comes down
            to the daily habits you have and the daily work you put in” is what they say. They’re not wrong either, but
            there is one major problem that I have with this notion. I find it difficult to continue to work hard at
            something for an extended period of time (i.e. over the course of weeks, months or years), especially if you
            do not see any immediate reward that can build that motivation. In a world where virtually anything we
            desire is on the phone in our pocket or is accessible through the technology surrounding us, we live in a
            world of instant gratification and hence expect to see results straight away. As a result, it is difficult
            to stay consistently motivated when your daily habits have no visible, short term benefit. The same goes for
            athletes. Usain Bolt did not just lift one weight once and suddenly became the fastest sprinter in the
            world. Success comes with daily practice and determination over the course of years, and world class sports
            players know that better than most. So how do they stay motivated?
        </p>

        <p>
            Even the best players in any sport experience demotivation. Hence, instead of trying to find out the secret
            behind how they stay motivated all the time, it is worth understanding what athletes do to stay on track at
            times when they are low on the drive to excel. One of the many things that they incorporate in their daily
            lives is reminders of a sense of purpose or long term goal. For New Zealand Rugby players, each individual
            has a personal ritual that they never fail to carry out before any game they play. In addition to this, they
            perform the famous Haka dance as a collective unit, a dance displaying the significance of the game to them
            and those who have come before them. Whether it be on the sports ground or in a lecture hall, we all have
            reasons for pursuing a certain long term goal. While these goals are good to have, they are easy to forget
            from time to time and so having a daily reminder of that goal can bring you on track in times of difficulty.
            For example, a meaningful phrase that you place on your bedside table is a small thing, but can start off
            your day with intention and purpose as you read it first thing in the morning.

        <h4 class="center-align"><b>Dealing with pressure</b></h4>

        <p>
            It goes without saying that athletes, especially those at the height of their sport, find themselves in
            pressured scenarios, falling in positions where their performance can win or lose an important match.
            Moreover, we all know of those players who you can count on to perform when it counts. While it may seem
            like it is at a smaller scale, we all also deal with daily pressures from all aspects of life. Pressure is
            inevitable, so how do certain athletes look at this and handle it so well?
        </p>

        <p>
            The first insight I got from sports documentaries was that sports coaches and players have a certain level
            of appreciation for pressure. Doc Rivers, American basketball coach and former player, said it best when he
            said “Pressure is a privilege”, explaining that pressured situations are a reminder of having the
            opportunity to play the game that you love. Furthermore, these personalities understand that growth, be it
            personal or as a team, occurs outside of the comfort zone. As a result, coaches try to mimic pressured
            scenarios when practising as a way of exposing players to the reality of the game in a competitive
            situation. For the students who are reading this, this may translate to incorporating time pressure when
            revising for an exam, or embracing the pressure of doing well in a particular assignment. Whatever the
            pressure may be for, being experienced deliberately or unwillingly, it is worth reminding yourself of the
            position you are in to be experiencing that pressure.
        </p>

        <p>
            When it comes to dealing with this stressful feeling, a lot of athletes place time and effort in learning
            how to “block out the noise” and hence performing when it counts. This is critical for the New Zealand Rugby
            team, so much so that a whole chapter in Legacy is dedicated to how the All Blacks players deal with the
            pressure that comes with game day. In this chapter, it walks through the importance of getting your mental
            state from one of cloudiness to one of clarity. This is exercised using a technique called “anchoring”,
            where an individual associates a certain action to moving to state of focus, hence making it a trigger for
            this transition as it is developed over time. For some this is pouring water on their face and for others it
            is quietly reciting a mantra. Don’t get me wrong. I am not asking you to pour water over your face every
            day. What I am suggesting, however, is to consider incorporating some small ritual that you can use to bring
            yourself back to focus after being overwhelmed with pressure. Meditation is something becoming increasingly
            popular amongst people of all lifestyles (including athletes), deliberately getting into a peaceful state of
            mind. Others exercise for a short period of time, useful for releasing “feel-good” hormones like serotonin.
            It will probably take some experimentation and time to figure out what works for you, but it will help in
            the long run.

        <p>
            I think a lot of people find athletes inspiring. Rightly so- their ability to compete at such a high level
            shows determination and talent. However, after looking at their strategies for success, I was reminded that
            they are also human. I wanted to break down what I thought contributed to the incredible, unimaginable
            success of famous athletes and sports teams into ideas that we can understand and attempt to incorporate
            into our own lives. I have tried to make an active effort to do this. For example, writing down what went
            well and badly at the end of every day allows me to see where my approach to the day can improve. All of
            these things and much more are cultivated and developed along with the physical health and skill required
            for athletes to be at the top of their game, and there is a lot we can learn from their practises and
            mindset
