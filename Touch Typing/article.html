            Having a desktop computer or a laptop is essential for the day to day lives of a lot of people. We may be
            forcing ourselves out of bed to watch that university lecture during the day or scrolling on YouTube for
            hours on end during the night. Either way, it is fair to say that life without that computer would be very
            different. How do we interact with this incredible
            device? Mostly by the keyboard and through the act of typing. So if we type so much, shouldn’t we at least
            be trying to type “better”? This was the question that came across my mind when I started to look into touch
            typing, and decided to dedicate time to learn and practise it last month.
        </p>

        <h4 class="container center-align"><b>What exactly is touch typing?</b></h4>

        <p>
            A good place to start this article is to get rid of some confusion some of you may be having as you read
            this. What is touch typing? Simply put, even though it may be hard to believe, there is a right and wrong
            way to type on a standard keyboard (also known as the QWERTY keyboard, which most of us are familiar with).
            Touch typing is the “right” style of typing. It is based on the principle that certain fingers should only
            press a small number of keys, putting an emphasis on all fingers being used to type English prose. Instead
            of searching for keys and only using your two index fingers to type (also known as the “hunt and peck”
            typing style), touch typing relies on using muscle memory and your knowledge of where each finger should be
            placed, removing the need to look at the keyboard while you type.
        </p>

        <h4 class="container center-align"><b>OK, but why did you get interested in this?</b></h4>

        <p>
            Now that you know what I decided to learn more about, you may be wondering why I even bothered practising in
            the first place. After all, it seems like quite a random thing to get involved in, so why bother? As you
            know, I study Computer Science, and as much as I hate to admit it, I spend A LOT of time typing. Whether it
            is programming or searching Google for something I don’t understand in my course (trust me- it happens a
            lot), the fact remains- I use my laptop for the majority of my day. Realising this simple fact started to
            spur an interest in using my laptop more efficiently. If I could find out a way to interact with my laptop
            more proficiently, not only would it feel great personally but I would also be able to reap the benefits of
            simply doing more in a certain period of time. With that, touch typing seemed to be a useful thing to start
            practising.
        </p>

        <h4 class="container center-align"><b>How exactly will touch typing benefit ME?</b></h4>

        <p>
            Some of you may go away from this article and forget all about touch typing within half an hour, and that’s
            fine. Nonetheless, some of you may want to see more. Doing more in less time is part of the story, but I
            quickly realised that there are more benefits that may not be obvious at first glance. I separate the
            advantages of touch typing in three main categories:
        </p>

        <h5 class="left-align"><b>Time</b></h5>

        <p>
            Here is my version of a quick touch typing lesson. Through particular hand placement, you will start to
            adapt to the idea that different fingers are “responsible” for pressing a small selection of keys on the
            keyboard. To give a small example, your left pinky finger is responsible for pressing ‘1’, ‘q’, ‘a’, ‘z’, as
            well as the ‘Tab’, ‘Caps Lock’ and ‘Shift’ keys (some of you may be confused, realising that you never use
            your pinky finger to type at all. Don’t worry- neither did I until a few weeks ago). With this technique,
            each finger does less work and moves around the keyboard less, and this saves time. Time that accumulates
            overtime. It does this in two main ways. First, with enough practice, you will be able to simply type more
            words per minute. Second, you will become more accurate with your typing, so no more of slamming the
            backspace in anger after typing the same word incorrectly five times. Dread that essay you need to write or
            that email you just want to get out of the way? You could literally get it over with in less time.
        </p>

        <h5 class="left-align"><b>Increased focus</b></h5>

        <p>
            Practising this style of typing is a productive thing to do for more reasons than simply saving time. An
            important part of touch typing, and something that was personally hard to grasp at first, is to beat the
            tendency to look at the keyboard and instead focus on the screen. The act of practising touch typing is all
            about building muscle memory so that your fingers are in the right place at the right time. Hence, typing
            becomes something that requires less brain power than it would have done when you spent time searching for
            keys to press. Looking at the keyboard and focusing on what you are pressing takes up more of your attention
            than you may think. The simple act of typing requires interaction from different parts of your brain,
            including those involved in strong motor skills and depicting language. With that said, by making the act of
            typing a more natural process that requires less thought, you free up mental capacity in your brain for
            other things, like focusing on the task at hand or coming up with more creative ideas.
        </p>

        <h5 class="left-align"><b>Physical benefits</b></h5>

        <p>
            Aside from the productivity angle, touch typing brought benefits that I never really considered. The main
            idea I ignored is the improvement of your posture as you type. The hand placement that is encouraged to make
            touch typing an easier task requires you to sit with your back straight, shoulders back and neck naturally
            aligned. I am aware that the majority of people reading this don’t experience chronic back pain and hence
            think that this point is not really applicable to them. I thought the same. Having said that, being forced
            to sit in a particular way opened my eyes to how far forward my neck would get and how hunched over I was
            when sitting. Simply put, my posture was shockingly bad. However, being mindful of where I place my fingers
            and how I sit has made for a more comfortable experience overall.
        </p>

        <h4 class="center-align"><b>I’ll try it out- but where do I start?</b></h4>

        <p>
            There may be a few of you out there that may decide to give this touch typing thing a go. If that is you, I
            would like to give a few tips that I have found helpful when it has come to learning and practising touch
            typing:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Accuracy before speed</b>- you may feel the tendency to type as fast as you can. Despite this urge
                (which I
                still feel on a daily basis), try to focus on accuracy of typing more than the speed, even if that means
                typing slower than what you would like. For a couple of weeks not too long ago, I dropped down to typing
                30 words per minute (which is not fast at all) to focus on accuracy. Whilst annoying at first, you will
                reap the benefits gradually overtime.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Daily practise</b>- at least when you begin to learn touch typing, I would recommend regular practice
                for a
                shorter period of time. For me, building the consistency has helped to develop the muscle memory that is
                required for certain hand placements to feel natural.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Take it as far as you want</b>- just because you may want to start learning does not mean that you
                should
                feel pressured to aim for absolute perfection. For example, I still make mistakes with which finger I
                use for certain keys, but I am happy with the changes that I have made with my typing habits as of now.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            It is worth putting out this disclaimer- I’m not an expert who types super fast or super accurately, and I
            don’t want to teach you nor persuade you. Instead, if there is one thing that I want to get out of this
            article, it is to bring across the point that there are many ways one could try to make more use of the time
            that they have, even if it is as simple as learning how to type faster. Having said this, if you are
            interested to find out more, feel free to message me regarding resources that I could recommend. The area of
            productivity is something that has interested me for a while, and I hope to write more about habits I have
            tried to form and lessons I have learned from people who get way too much done in a day.
