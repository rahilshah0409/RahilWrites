        <p>
            You have found yourself at the start of this article, and some of you may already be a bit confused.
            Generalist? Specialist? What do these terms actually mean, especially in the context of the topic matter
            of this article? A generalist is formally defined as:
        </p>
        <p class="center-align">
            <i>
                “a person whose knowledge, aptitudes, and skills are applied to a field as a whole or to a variety
                of different fields”.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            If there is someone in your life that you think does a bit of everything, then they are what you would
            call a generalist. They may be academically smart, but also play the piano well, but also are the best
            footballer you know.
        </p>
        <p>
            A specialist, on the other hand, is formally defined as:
        </p>
        <p class="center-align">
            <i>
                “a person who devotes himself or herself to one subject or to one particular branch of a subject or
                pursuit”.
            </i>
        </p>
        <p>
            This refers to someone that is exceptional at one thing because of spending a lot of their time on it.
            We may know that one person who spends all their free time in the gym and is really physically fit, or
            someone who only seems to do maths problems in their spare time and seems mathematically gifted. They
            are
            specialists.
        </p>

        <p>
            The question of whether you should be a generalist or specialist may hold personal meaning depending on
            who you are. I believe that this fundamental question spills and feeds into a lot of different aspects
            of life, from the mindset that drives you daily to the values and morals you have as a human being. It
            is one that has been on my mind a lot over the last couple of months. I would like to get involved in as
            much as I could in secondary school, whether it be mathematics or sport or art or drama. However, coming
            to university, I gradually came up to a fork in the road, constantly debating on whether I should
            continue this generalist mentality or focus more on my course and career. It was a debate that drove me
            insane at times and may be one you are thinking about too.

            Another name for a generalist is a “Renaissance Man”, a name that comes from the fact that there were many
            men and women of this nature in the Renaissance period. It was, in fact, the generalists that were respected
            and held in high regard in societies as early as the Romans. An example of such a person is Leonardo Di
            Vinci. Widely recognised for being the famous artist responsible for the Mona Lisa, Di Vinci also made great
            contributions to the world of mathematics and astronomy. An engineer who also had great interests in
            literature and botany. This is just the start of the long list of interests he had and fields he was
            involved in. Another example is Nikola Tesla- a humanitarian, inventor, mathematician and electrical
            engineer. These people, at the time, were highly respected in almost all the fields they took interest in
            and it is fair to say that they weren’t specialists.
        </p>

        <p>
            Do you know anyone with the same kind of life as Di Vinci or Tesla? My guess: maybe not. But why is this? As
            discussed in Zach Jones’ Ted talk, modern society has developed into one where specialisation is promoted,
            and generalisation is seen more as the exception rather than the rule. Take the education system we find
            ourselves in. We go from nursery to primary school, and then to secondary school to take our GCSEs. We are
            then told to pick three or four subjects to pursue further, before typically being told to choose one course
            to study at university two years later (I am aware that not all young people take this path, but this is a
            path commonly taken). We go through university and develop skills that lead us into a particular role in a
            particular industry.
        </p>

        <p>
            This path of life can be considered by some as unidirectional and specialist, but there is good reason for
            this structure. The problems that we face as a society and the progress that we have made (scientific,
            industrial or otherwise) requires detailed knowledge in certain areas. This is where specialists thrive.
            Going into depth in one or a selected few things allows them to come incredibly good or knowledgeable at it.
            This can bring a lot of personal and societal benefits, from breakthroughs in fields that improve our
            understanding of the world to becoming a famous musician. Take Michael Jordan for example. In the Netflix
            documentary “The Last Dance”, viewers get an insight into Jordan’s winning mentality and his amazing work
            ethic that was fuelled by his sheer and undisturbed love for the game of basketball, resulting in him
            becoming one of the best players of all time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Nonetheless, living life as a specialist does come with its drawbacks, and society being centred around
            specialisation does not mean that generalisation has no place. While focusing on depth in which one delves
            into their craft, a specialist sacrifices the breadth that come with exploring several interests. In the
            context of a career, doors are open for a generalist in comparison to a specialist- credit to the
            development of adaptability to differing scenarios. Furthermore, the skills and abilities of a generalist
            may prove to be necessary soon. Speaking on a larger scale, the knowledge and experience that one gains from
            exploring different areas allows the bridging of seemingly unrelated ideas; crucial in making progress to
            solve the world’s most pressing future problems that involve existential risk (risk involving the existence
            of humanity) like AI safety and nuclear warfare.
        </p>

        <p>
            Considering whether you should strive to be a generalist or a specialist is a question of depth VS breadth,
            and how many differing hats you are willing to wear and add to your identity. It is important to realise
            that in today’s constantly evolving society, great gain usually comes when both kinds of people collaborate
            with one another. Nonetheless, the question still remains.

            Personally, I have been influenced by many views on the topic and have boiled the gathered insight down into
            a view which I urge you to consider. This is a concept introduced to me by Tim Ferris, who was asked to
            answer the same question. Through the course of this article, I have expressed the nature of being
            specialist and being generalist as though they are two completely opposing ways to live your life. However,
            there does exist a middle ground where both concepts coexist. This is explained by Ferris as being a
            “specialised generalist” or the “layering of skills” as the author and entrepreneur James Clear puts it.
            This entails realising unrelated interests and finding a way to combine these distinct ideas to create a
            (potentially unique) niche that you can pursue in depth. This is applicable in the context of a career or
            someone simply pursuing a hobby/interest, and I found that it was an interesting perspective to take. An
            example of a “specialised generalist” is Scott Adams, someone who’s interest in drawing and experience in
            business created the Dilbert comic strip; a comic known for its sarcastic office humour.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this article provides one option to ponder upon, it is important to mention that there is no answer
            that suits everyone. Some may argue that there is no concrete answer at all- there should be no preference
            over the two. Others may bring up the compelling argument that different times in your life may call for
            different approaches, and there is not one answer that can serve you for the rest of your life. This is a
            view that I agree with to some extent. Nonetheless, I’d love to know what you all think.
